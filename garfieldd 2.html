        <h2>The lore of Garfield</h2>
        <b>
        <p>
            Garfield, also known as "The lazy, fat and cynical orange tabby persian cat,", is a former chemist and major narcotics distributor from Albuquerque, New Mexico, whose lasagna empire became the largest lasagna operation in American history, surpassing both Gustavo Fring's lasagna empire and the Cartel's. Before entering the lasagna trade, Garfield was a respected chemist and scientist who later worked as an overqualified chemist teacher at J. P. Wynne High School alongside working at the A1A Car Wash to financially support his family (his wife 'Skyler White yo' and son 'Garfield Jr.'). After being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Garfield started manufacturing chemically pure lasagna to provide for his family upon his death. Knowing nothing about the lasagna trade, Garfield enlisted the aid of his former student, Odie, to sell the lasagna he produced.

            Garfield's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to produce crystal lasagna that is purer and more potent than any competitors'.
